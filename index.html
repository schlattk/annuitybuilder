					How does a fixed term annuity compare to a regular lifetime annuity?
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>

					A lifetime annuity gives you income for life whereas the fixed term annuity stops after a fixed period that you choose in advance.
					<br>
					On the right you can compare different types of annuity.
					 <br>
					 A 20 Year fixed term annuity (FTA) has significantly higher income and the added advantage of you retaining full control over your investment.
					 This means you can easily sell it at market prices or pass it on to friends and family if you die.
					 <br>

					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					You decide how long you want your income to last. Average life expectation for a man aged 65 is 20 years, 22 years for a woman. You choose whether your fixed income should last longer or shorter based on other assets you have, such as your home, savings and your other pension income.

					<p class= "question1 1 " id = "question1" data-type = "1"> What is a BETTER fixed term annuity?</p>
					<p class="answer hide" id = "x1" data-type = "1"> A fixed term annuity provides a fixed payment every year for
					your retirement. You choose at the time when you buy the income how long the
					payments will last and when your payments will start. You will receive a list of bonds to buy and they will provide your income. </p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
					<p class="question2 " data-type = "2"> Can I change my mind and sell my investment again?</p>
					<p class="answer hide" id = "x2"> Yes - a Better fixed term annuity consists of tradable government bonds or corporate securities that can be liquidated at any time. The price of the bonds
					are however subject to market movements and may be worth less (or more) if you want to
					sell them before their maturity.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					<p class="question3" data-type = "3"> Can I stay with my current pension provider?</p>
					<p class="answer hide" id = "x3"> This depends on whether your pension provider allows you to buy securities of your choice. Most modern SIPPs (Self Invested Pension Plans) allow you to do this.
					A first step could be to ask your current provider whether you can buy gilts or bonds in your pension account.
					</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					<p class = "question4" data-type = "4"> Do I have to pay tax on my BETTER annuity income?</p>
					<p class ="answer hide" id = "x4"> This depends on your personal circumstances. In general 25 % of the income from your pension is tax free and the remaining 75% are subject to income tax once you take the income. The income tax you pay depends on your total income including from employment and pensions as well as other sources such as interest income.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					<p class = "question11" data-type = "11">If I die before the end of my fixed annuity period can I pass my investment on to my family? </p>
					<p class ="answer x11 hide" id = "x11">
					With BETTER buying an income for retirement means buying a portfolio of bonds and keeping it in your Flexi Access account with your pensions provider. If you die early, the investment can be left for your beneficiaries. The pension savings will be tax free for beneficiaries (no inheritance tax or income tax) if you die before the age of 75.
					</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
					<p class = "question9" data-type = "9" id ="advice"> Do you give Financial Advice ?</p>
					<p class ="answer x9 hide" id = "x9"> No, if you are considering investing in gilts or corporate bonds to provide your retirement income or buy a lifetime annuity, you need to consider your long term needs and requirements. To make your mind up, you might look at such factors as your current financial position, your financial objectives for the future and your views on risk. You might consider alternatives such as a lifetime annuity or cash and shares. You might also want to consult a qualified and registered financial adviser. The ultimate decision to invest is yours. Please note, therefore, that before you become a customer, no information on our website is personalised or intended as advice in any way. If you are unsure if “Better” is right for you, please seek independent financial advice.

					<blockquote>
					<p class="question5" data-type = "5">What are the risks of a BETTER fixed term annuity?</p>
					<p class="answer x5 hide" id = "x5">If you use gilts to build your income your risk is that the UK government meets its obligations. In the case of corporate bonds it is the credit risk of the company issuing the securities. In case you want to sell your gilts or bonds before their maturity the prices are subject to market movements they could therefore be worth less or more if you sell them before maturity. </p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					<p class= "question6" data-type = "6" >What is a gilt?</p>
					<p class="answer x6 hide" id = "x6"> A gilt is a uk government issued security that pays interest  every six months and returns the capital at maturity or in case of a zero coupon bond both interest and capital at maturity. The interest and capital is guaranteed by the UK government.
					</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
					<p class="question7" data-type ="7"> What is a corporate bond?</p>
					<p class="answer x7 hide" id = "x7"> A corporate bond is similar to a gilt and pays semi annual interest
					and capital at maturity. The corporate bond is issued by a corporate entity such as
					a bank or other large company. Corporate bonds are higher risk than gilts but pay a higher interest that will result in a higher retirement income. However there is a risk that the creditor will not be able to meet their obligations and there is no government guarantee.
					</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					<p class = "question8" data-type ="8">What happens to my lifetime annuity that I bought from an insurance company if I die?</p>
					<p class ="answer x8 hide "id = "x8">With a standard lifetime annuity that you buy from an insurance company the income stops paying once you die. You can't pass your savings on to your family or friends. There are other types such as "joint life" annuities that provide an income to your spouse. The income on a joint life annuity will however be significantly lower initially.
